## 碎碎念

感觉UIUC的这个简洁的"I"很适合背景（吗？）

## AC SYSTEM DEFROSTING MODEL AND CONTROL

和老板开会之后，之前实验数据分析需要更加全面。

* Analyze heat transfer performance, including energy distribution pie **[2hr]**
* Perform experiment with shorter "Compressor ON" time see if it reduce energy. (Trial) **[1day]**
* Defrosting model testing (single tube, no distribution consideration, time dependent) and compare to experiment. **[2days]**

---

## FROST GROWTH MODEL

继续跑Midea要求的模拟情况（extruded fin），并且尝试anti-frosting surface design

* Run simulation case of extruded fin **[4days]**
    * don't run too many cases at same time, memory of PC (48GB) is not large enough
* Post-process the anti-frosting fin design by Joon. **[1hour]**
* Run simulation case of anti-frosting fin design. **[1day]**

---

## DEFROSTING WATER DRAINAGE

Apex shape for water drainage enhancement

* Clean surface with plasma in cleanroom. **[1hr]**
* Test frost growth on these samples. **[3days]**

---

## PURDUE CONFERENCE

Finish the presentation (sad face)

* Defrosting model presentation. **[2days]**
* Frosting model presentation. **[2days]**

---


## 注

先做slides... 真的是要死了，法环的dlc刚公布，好想玩。
